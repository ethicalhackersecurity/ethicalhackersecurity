- ⚡ Fun fact: ... some ethical hackers use "honeytokens" to catch malicious actors. honeytokens are fake, sensitive-looking data (like fake credit card numbers,
login credentials, or documents) planted in systems. when an attacker accesses or moves this fake data, it sends an alert to the ethical hacker, pinpointing the intruders
and location. think of it as digital bait that tracks the thief without them even knowing.
